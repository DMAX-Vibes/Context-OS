# Context OS

**A portable, plain-Markdown context layer for AI agents.** Stop re-explaining who you are, what you're working on, and how you like to work every time you open a new chat, switch tools, or start a fresh session.

Context OS is a small set of Markdown files plus loading rules. You fill in the blanks once. Then any AI tool — Claude Code, Codex, ChatGPT, Gemini, Cursor, a local model — reads the right files, in the right order, and works the way you want without a 20-message warm-up.

It's not a framework, an app, or a dependency. It's just files. You own them. They travel with you.

> The name rides the "LLM OS" metaphor (the model is the CPU, your context window is the RAM). What this actually gives you is the **memory + loading policy** layer — the part everyone keeps rebuilding by hand in every new chat.

## The problem it solves

Every new session, you re-explain:

- who you are and what you do
- which projects are live and what state they're in
- your stack, your conventions, your "please give me commands not lectures"
- what's private and must not leak

Pasting one giant bio doesn't scale: it's too big for small tasks, out of date in a week, and leaks private info into tools that don't need it. Context OS fixes that with **modular files** and **a rule for what to load when**.

```

Three ideas do all the work:

1. **Load the smallest useful bundle.** A quick question loads almost nothing. A coding session loads your stack + the one project. You never dump everything.
2. **Privacy is a layer, not a hope.** Anything sensitive lives in `*_PRIVATE.md` files that are *opt-in per task* and **git-ignored by default**, so they don't get committed or fed to tools that don't need them.
3. **It updates itself (with your approval).** Every meaningful session ends with "did we learn anything durable?" — the agent proposes a patch to the right file, you say yes, and the context stays current instead of rotting.

## Load Levels (the core rule)

`MANIFEST.md` tells the agent how much to load:

| Level | When | Loads |
|---|---|---|
| **0 — Orientation** | quick chat, tight context | `YOU_CONTEXT.md` (or just its compact prompt) |
| **1 — General work** | most non-code tasks | `+ YOU_PROJECTS.md` if relevant |
| **2 — Technical** | coding, deploy, debugging | `+ YOU_TECH_STACK.md + projects/<name>/…` |
| **3 — Career** | resume, portfolio, applications | `+ YOU_CAREER.md` |
| **4 — Private** | only when you say so | `+ *_PRIVATE.md` overlays |

---

## Quick start (the easy way)

You don't fill these files in by hand. Let the AI do it from what it already knows about you.

1. **Get the files** — fork/clone this repo, or download it as a folder. Keep it somewhere stable (e.g. `~/context-os/`).
2. **Point your AI tool at the folder and say:**

   > **"Read SETUP.md and set up Context OS for me."**

   It reads your repo, your prior context, and anything it already knows, drafts your `YOU_*.md` files, shows you the draft, and asks only about the gaps. You start filled-in, never blank. (See [`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md).)
3. **End sessions with the loop** — paste `prompts/session-end.md` ("did we learn anything durable?"). Approve the patch. The context keeps itself current.

That's the whole loop. Everything below is reference for when you want to go deeper.

### Doing it by hand (optional)

Prefer to fill them in yourself? Open the `YOU_*.md` files — each has instructions and an example at the top. You only *need* `YOU_CONTEXT.md` to start. Then:

- **Claude Code** reads `CLAUDE.md` automatically · **Codex / coding agents** read `AGENTS.md` automatically.
- **ChatGPT / Gemini / others:** paste `prompts/handoff.md` plus the relevant `YOU_*.md` file(s).
- **Add a project:** copy `projects/example-project/` to `projects/your-project/` and fill it in.

> **Privacy note:** `YOU_PRIVATE.md` and `YOU_CAREER_PRIVATE.md` are git-ignored by default (see `.gitignore`). Copy the `*.example.md` versions to the real filename and fill them in — your real private files will never be committed.

## What's in here

**System files (use as-is):**

- `MANIFEST.md` — the loader: load levels, source-of-truth order, privacy/verification rules
- `TOOL_ADAPTERS.md` — how to adapt to a specific tool, plus a self-adapter for unknown tools
- `CLAUDE.md` — entry point + working rules for Claude Code
- `AGENTS.md` — entry point + working rules for Codex-style agents
- `prompts/` — reusable bootstrap / project-start / session-end / handoff / merge prompts

**Your content (fill in the blanks):**

- `YOU_CONTEXT.md` — who you are, how you want agents to work *(start here)*
- `YOU_PROJECTS.md` — live project index + status
- `YOU_TECH_STACK.md` — stack, commands, conventions, gotchas
- `YOU_CAREER.md` / `YOU_CREATIVE.md` — optional domain modules
- `YOU_PRIVATE.example.md` / `YOU_CAREER_PRIVATE.example.md` — copy → fill → stays local
- `projects/example-project/` — template for per-project context

---

## Design principles

- **Plain Markdown, no lock-in.** Every file is human-readable and tool-agnostic. No runtime, no install.
- **Order-independent.** Whichever tool touches the files first, you should converge on the same useful context. No tool's version is "primary."
- **Current state, not a transcript.** These files are a maintained source of truth, not a chat log. Keep them lean; update deliberately.
- **You decide.** Agents *propose* updates. They don't silently rewrite who you are.
